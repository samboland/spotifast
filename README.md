# Spotifast

**Spotify, native and fast.** Spotifast is a Spotify client written in
Rust with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). It plays music through
[librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot), typically uses
100–250 MB of RAM, starts in well under a second, and has no browser engine.
It runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Switching songs clears held audio from the previous song, including during
a silent intro. Natural track transitions remain gapless. The player bar's
volume slider responds on press, without waiting for pointer movement.
The default audio output smooths volume changes over 30 ms and uses 50 ms
fades for explicit song changes and stopping.
The player bar uses a handheld microphone for lyrics and a music list for the queue.

**Playback needs Spotify Premium.** Free accounts can browse and search, but
cannot play music through Spotifast.
